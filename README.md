## Results


### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model



Questions on Data Preprocessing:
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?


- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?


- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?


.

### Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model



Questions on Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?


- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?


- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?



.

### Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
